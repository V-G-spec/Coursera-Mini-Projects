# Some Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

## About
I wanted to do some projects to completely understand the application of machine-learning and deep-learning models and for that I did many short
projects on [Coursera](www.coursera.org)

These are for my own future reference. In case I am working upon some project along the similar lines and ran into some syntactical issue or perhaps just needed to
refresh my memory on the relevant libraries or available datasets
